# Connection between Openwebrx and Mongodb

Software/Container connects with Openwebrx and MongoDB which have to be defined in the data.ini File. 

I have on one tuner in Openwebrx a band plan where I define the timeslots and the band. A copy of that is in band_slots.py.

If a signal is recived in that band_slot the recived signal will be save in MongoDB. 
That will help to make statistics of recived signals.
